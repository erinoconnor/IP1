# IP1-Project
IP1 Project for 2nd semester Computing(BSc). Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It is and industry standard and has been recommended to us by Bobby so we should at least make an attempt to use it. If you guys have any issues message me and I will try and help you out :)

I can give you a brief tutorial on roughly what you would do for our project:

1. Open Windows Powershell (or equivalent) and navigate to a directory of your choice. Something like Documents, or a folder in Documents called Uni work or something.
2.
